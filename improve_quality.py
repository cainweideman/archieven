"""
Image Processing Script

This script processes images stored within a specified directory structure. Each image is:
- Converted to grayscale
- Binarized (converted to black and white)
- Cropped to remove a small margin from each edge
- Saved in a subfolder within each directory.

Modules:
    - cv2: For image reading, processing, and saving.
    - os: For directory and file handling.

Functions:
    - display_image: Display an image with matplotlib.
    - grayscale: Convert an image to grayscale.
    - binarize_image: Apply binary thresholding to a grayscale image.
    - crop_image: Crop a specified margin from the image edges.
    - process_images_in_directory: Main function that processes images in a directory structure.
    - process_image: Function that processes one specific image
    - process_directory: Function that processes the images in a specific directory
