### Installing Anaconda on Windows

Here’s a comprehensive guide to installing Anaconda on Windows, creating and managing environments, and installing packages with Conda.

#### Step 1: Download and Install Anaconda

1. **Download Anaconda**:
   - Go to the [Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
   - Select the Windows installer and download the version compatible with your system (usually 64-bit).

2. **Run the Installer**:
   - Open the downloaded `.exe` file to start the installation.
   - Follow the prompts and choose the recommended settings. This typically includes adding Anaconda to your PATH, which simplifies using Anaconda from the command line.
   - Complete the installation.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open the **Anaconda Prompt** (search for it in the Start menu).
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     conda --version
     ```
   - If installed correctly, you should see the version number displayed.

#### Step 2: Create an Anaconda Environment

1. **Open Anaconda Prompt**:
   - Open the **Anaconda Prompt** from your Start menu.

2. **Create a New Environment**:
   - To create a new environment with a specific Python version, use:
     ```bash
     conda create -n myenv python=3.11
     ```
     Replace `myenv` with the name you want for your environment, and `3.11` with your desired Python version.

3. **Confirm Environment Creation**:
   - You may be prompted to confirm package downloads. Type `y` and press Enter to proceed.

---

#### Step 3: Activate and Deactivate an Environment

1. **Activate the Environment**:
   - In Anaconda Prompt, activate your environment with:
     ```bash
     conda activate myenv
     ```
     Replace `myenv` with the name of your environment.

2. **Deactivate the Environment**:
   - To return to the base environment, simply type:
     ```bash
     conda deactivate
     ```

---

#### Step 4: Install Packages in an Environment

1. **Installing Packages with Conda**:
   - Once in your desired environment, you can install packages with Conda. For example:
     ```bash
     conda install numpy
     ```
   - You can also specify the channel (like `conda-forge`) for specific packages if needed:
     ```bash
     conda install -c conda-forge pandas
     ```

2. **Verifying Installed Packages**:
   - To see a list of installed packages in your environment, use:
     ```bash
     conda list
     ```

Your Anaconda installation and environment setup are now complete! You can now install additional packages and manage multiple environments for different projects.




### Installing Pytesseract with Tesseract OCR on Windows

Here’s a step-by-step guide to install Pytesseract and set up Tesseract OCR with additional language support for Dutch (Flemish).

---

#### Step 1: Install Pytesseract in Conda Environment

1. Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt.
2. Run the following command to install `pytesseract` from the `conda-forge` channel:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge pytesseract
   ```

---

#### Step 2: Install Tesseract OCR on Your PC

1. **Download Tesseract**:
   - Go to the [Tesseract OCR Installation page](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
   - Download the 64-bit Windows installer: `tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.4.0.20240606.exe`.
   
2. **Run the Installer**:
   - Launch the downloaded `.exe` file to start installation.
   - During installation, select **Dutch (Flemish)** under additional language options if you need OCR for that language.

---

#### Step 3: Add Tesseract OCR to Your PATH

1. Open **Edit System Environment Variables**.
2. Click on **Environment Variables**.
3. Under **User Variables**, select **Path** and click **Edit**.
4. Click **New** and add the following path:
   ```
   C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR
   ```

---

#### Step 4: Configure Tesseract Path in Python Script

To make sure Python can find Tesseract OCR, add this line to your Python script:
```python
import pytesseract
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = 'C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe'
```

---

Your Pytesseract setup is now complete! You’re ready to use Tesseract OCR in Python for text extraction from images, with support for Dutch and Flemish if you selected it during installation.
